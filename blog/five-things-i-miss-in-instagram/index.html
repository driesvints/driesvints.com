    <h1>Five things I miss in Instagram</h1>

    <p><a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a> is one of those social networking apps that really stuck to me. I usually try one out but quickly remove it again when it doesn't immediately appeal to me. It took me ages before my friends finally convinced me to use <a href="https://www.snapchat.com/">Snapchat</a> and I'm still not overly fond of it even though I regularly use it these days.</p>
<p>But not Instagram. I check it multiple times a day and regularly use it. I mostly use it privately with friends and family. Because I use it so much I'm noticing some of Instagram's shortcomings. Things where the service is lacking and where it can definitely be improved. Below is a list with five of the things I miss most in Instagram.</p>
<h2>Multiple accounts</h2>
<p>This is probably the most obvious one. I'm currently using a private account to share with just friends and family but I wouldn't mind having a public account so I could share photos publicly as well. If I wanted to do this now I would constantly have to log out and in again in order to switch accounts. This is pretty inconvenient.</p>
<p>I know some of my friends which run businesses and who use Instagram as a primary medium for their business. They already have multiple accounts, some of them even up to 6 different accounts. Even though tools like <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> make it easy for us to remember passwords these days, it's still quite a hassle to switch accounts by logging out and in every time.</p>
<p>This is definitely the thing which ranks highest on my list of features I want for Instagram.</p>
<h2>Photo and video visibility</h2>
<p>Even better would be if I could share my photos or videos publicly or with just friends. The same way <a href="https://facebook.com">Facebook</a> does actually. That would even take away the need for me to manage multiple accounts.</p>
<p>Instagram already has a feature called &quot;Instagram Direct&quot; so you can send photos to specific friends only, kind of like the way Snapchat does. But I rarely use the feature and it doesn't allows me to send to all my friends at once with a single button. A public/friends option would be great.</p>
<h2>Change your profile picture with your own photos</h2>
<div class="center">
    <img src="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dries-personal/blog/2015-01-04-five-things-i-miss-in-instagram/instagram-change-profile-picture.jpg" alt="Changing your Instagram profile picture">
</div>
<p>Did you know that if you want to change your Instagram profile picture you cannot use any of your own Instagram photos? When trying to change your profile picture you have a wide arrange of options: using your Twitter or Facebook picture, importing one from your device or taking a new one.</p>
<p>But you cannot use one of your own photos. This strikes me as bizarre and plainly illogical. A photo service which doesn't allows you to use one of the apps photos as your profile picture.</p>
<p>What's more is that I cannot even download my own photo to my device in order to use the import feature to set it as a profile picture. I'd have to take a screenshot, crop the picture and import it. Why cannot I download my pictures? I took them, they belong to me.</p>
<h2>Better notifications</h2>
<p>Instagram is seriously lacking on the notifications part. For instance, in the iOS app, the app isn't even using the badge counter functionality. I'd have to go into the app and check my notifications manually to see if there were new ones.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that you have to mention someone in a comment thread they're participating in, to let them know you're talking to them is pretty tiresome. Why can't you be automatically subscribed to comment threads when you post a comment? It would be great if that was a preference. You could even have options like &quot;get notifications for all comments&quot; and &quot;get notifications only from original poster&quot; if you just want to know when the original poster replied. Now if you talk to someone but forget to mention them, chances are likely that they'll never know you said something to them.</p>
<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>This is a feature which <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> makes great use of. I can follow only the people I want for my main timeline and use lists to keep track of everything else. It would be great if Instagram had a likewise feature where I could group certain accounts in lists and change the list I'm looking at from the top navigation bar. This in combination with private/public lists would allow for some great new Instagram functionality.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>But of course Instagram is already a great service, one which I use daily. It's easy to take a picture or video of something you're doing or seeing at the moment and share it with all of your friends immediately. The fact that it's a separate app from Facebook is a plus because it takes away all of the noise which sometimes clutters the Facebook app. But there's room for improvement. Starting with any of the five points above. I hope Instagram will address these one day.</p></div>
