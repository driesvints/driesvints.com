Some of you might be wondering where this week's Larvel Weekly has gone to? It actually has been moved to [laravel.io](http://laravel.io/). You can [read issue #10 here](http://laravel.io/topic/28/laravel-weekly-10).<!--more-->

The reason why I'm moving Laravel Weekly to someplace else is because I felt that Laravel Weekly needed some place different than my blog, somewhere where it migh be more fitting to post it. There couldn't be a better place for it than the Laravel community portal. So from now on you can read Laravel Weekly every week on laravel.io.

I also added a few new things like an event calendar and I'll be doing interviews with community members from now on. The first one is [an interview with Niall O'Brien](http://laravel.io/topic/26/an-interview-with-niall-obrien), one of Laravel's most active community members.

I'd like to thank all of you for your continuing support and comments. I've been getting more and more awesome feedback ever since I started this and it's been an amazing ride so far. See you next week for issue #11.
