Small update this week. I also decided to change the name from my posts to just "Laravel" so I can post about Laravel in general and not just about Laravel 4 specifically.<!--more-->

## Laravel Meetup 20/04

Last night we had a Laravel meetup in Amsterdam, organised by [Jeroen Gerits](https://twitter.com/JeroenGerits). We had a great time talking about Laravel and everyday things, having a few drinks and some dinner and hanging out. It was nice meeting other Laravel developers in person. Thanks to everyone who came out!

This will definitely not be the last one. Stay tuned for more meetups in the future!
