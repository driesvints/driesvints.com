### Laravel: Code Bright

There's a new ebook called [Code Bright](https://leanpub.com/codebright) coming up for Laravel 4. [Dayle Rees](https://twitter.com/daylerees) is rewriting his [Code Happy](https://leanpub.com/codehappy) book for the newest version of Laravel. Expect noting less than awesome tutorials on learning how to use Laravel 4.

Dayle also updated [his website](http://daylerees.com/) recently where he blogs frequently about Laravel.

### Help Document The Laravel 4 Wiki FAQ

I don't know if many people know this but there is a Laravel wiki. There's some help needed with updating the Laravel 4 FAQ before L4 gets released in May. Feel free to contribute!
